        <p>I have gained a tremendous respect for artists and the artistic process working for Artists Wanted, a sister company of 3rd Ward in Brooklyn. </p>
        <p>Artists Wanted focuses on supporting emerging artists through online contests and portfolio management applications. It was my responsibility to design client interfaces that present complex data models, as well as client and server side application development- carrying a project from concept to launch.</p>

        <p>While it has no relation to my experience as a programmer or media designer, working on the deconstruction team at the non‐profit environmental organization, The Re‐store, was one of my favorite work experiences. After spending 10 hours a day ripping out sheet rock, de‐shingling roof‐tops, prying up hardwood floors, hand‐dismantling three‐story homes to the foundation, and carefully sorting the materials to be either resold, recycled or safely disposed of...the coffee I now sip in the comfort of my home office needs no sugar. Those grueling shifts make optimizing for internet explorer a delightful experience.</p>
